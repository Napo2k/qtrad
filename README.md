## Workflow

### To Generate Strategies

- **StrategyQuant** (for MetaTrader 5):
  - Generate
  - Retest
  - Optimize

- **TradingView** or also **MetaTrader 5**:
  - Search for descriptions of strategies and have **Claude** generate them:
    - Use YouTube with a strategy -> Gemini to transcribe -> Claude to generate for TradingView and MetaTrader 5.

- **MetaTrader 5 Market**:
  - Explore available strategies.

- **TradingView**:
  - Investigate mechanisms for strategy generation.

### Select a Few Strategies

- From **Squant** into MetaTrader (or AI-generated):
  - Retest on all symbols:
    - Try H1 and Daily timeframes.
  - Grab ones that are profitable **across several symbols**.

### Deploy

- Start slow with a small amount of money **somewhere**.
- Begin with the computer at work:
  - Use both TradingView and MetaTrader 5.
  - Consider using one broker for each platform.

\- Workflow

&nbsp;	- To generate strategies

&nbsp;		- StrategyQuant (for MetaTrader 5)

&nbsp;			- Generate

&nbsp;			- Retest

&nbsp;			- Optimize

&nbsp;		- Trading View or also MetaTrader 5

&nbsp;			- Search for descriptions of strategies and have \*\*Claude\*\* generate them

&nbsp;				- Youtube with a strategy -> Gemini to transcribe -> Claude to generate for TradingView and MetaTrader5

&nbsp;		- MetaTrader 5 market

&nbsp;		- I imagine TradingView also has mechanisms for that

&nbsp;	- Select a few from Squant into MetaTrader (or AI generated)

&nbsp;		- Retest on all symbols

&nbsp;			- Try H1, Daily

&nbsp;		- Grab ones that are profitable \*across several symbols\*

&nbsp;	- Deploy

&nbsp;		- Slow start with little money \*somewhere\*

&nbsp;		- Start with the computer at work

&nbsp;			- Both TradingView and MT5

&nbsp;			- Maybe one broker each
